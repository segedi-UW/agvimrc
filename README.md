# How to use
1. Clone into the directory to be used ($HOME for user level, root for system / Program files on windows)
2. Link the .vimrc file in agvimrc and the .vim directory to their respective names on your system

 I have provided scripts for doing this for you. If on linux use the setup.sh script, if on windows use the setup.ps1 (it assumes _vimrc is the name).
